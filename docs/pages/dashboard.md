### ðŸŒŸ Dashboard

This page is only accessible to you. 

The Dashboard provides a personalized overview of the your activity within the Beaunity platform.

It is designed with a clean, card-based layout, displaying key sections for posts, challenges, and events, along 
with user statistics. Furthermore, detailed information about each post, challenge, or event you have joined or added
to your favourites is provided, including comments and, in the case of events and challenges, the list of people attending.

The Stats table shows the total Likes, Favourites, and Comments across Posts, Events, and Challenges.
