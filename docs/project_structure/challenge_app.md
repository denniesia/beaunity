üíª Challenge Model

The Challenge Model inherits the BaseActivity abstract class, which contains:

| Field          | Type              | Description                                                                                |

| Mixins                | Description                                                        |

- Meta options:
  - verbose_name_plural = "Challenges"
  - permissions - 'Can approve challenge'
  - properties:
    - progress - Calculates the progress of the challenge in percentage (0% before start, 100% after end.
    - duration_in_weeks - Returns the total challenge duration in weeks, rounded up.


üîß Role Management: 

Regular authenticated users have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) permissions for the Challenge model.
After a challenge is created, it must be approved by a member of the Superuser group or the Moderator group before it becomes publicly visible. 
Unauthenticated user cannot see a full list of the posted challenges.


üå∑ Admin Panel

The ChallengeAdmin class customizes how challenges are managed in the Django admin panel:
- List Display: Shows title, created_by, created_at, start_time and end_time fields for quick overview.
- Ordering: Challenges are ordered by created_at in descending order (newest first). 
- Search: Allows searching by title or created_by for easier navigation.

## üåøRestFull Api Contents

**üåª Serializers:**
ensure the API receives the expected data and responds consistently.

The project uses two serializers to handle Challenge data in different contexts:
- ChallengeSerializer -  is used for retrieving and displaying challenge data in a structured JSON format. 
It is based on the Challenge model and includes related data such as categories and the user who created the challenge. 
  - Validation:
    - validate_data method - ensures that the challenge description contains at least 100 characters of plain text 
    (HTML tags are stripped before validation using bleach).
    - validate_poster_image method - Validates the image using a custom CloudinaryExtensionandSizeValidator to check 
    for allowed file types and size limits.
    - validate method - ensures the end_time is after the start_time.
    
````python
class ChallengeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    categories = CategorySimpleSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    created_by = UserSerializer(read_only=True)

- ChallengeCreateSerializer - extends ChallengeSerializer and is used specifically for creating new challenges.
````python
class ChallengeCreateSerializer(ChallengeSerializer):
    categories = serializers.SlugRelatedField(
        queryset=Category.objects.all(),
        slug_field='title',

üåª **API Views**

- api/#/challenge/ - This ModelViewSet provides full CRUD operations for the Challenge model.
It uses ChallengeCreateSerializer for creating challenges (allows category selection by slug) and ChallengeSerializer 
for reading and other operations. The logged-in user is automatically set as the created_by field when creating a challenge.

````python
class ChallengeViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Challenge.objects.filter(
        is_approved=True
    ).select_related(
        "created_by"
    ).prefetch_related(
        "categories", "attendees"
    )

    def get_serializer_class(self):
        if self.action == 'create':
            return ChallengeCreateSerializer
        return ChallengeSerializer

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action in ['update', 'partial_update', 'destroy']:
            return [IsCreator()]
        return [IsAuthenticated()]

    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        user = self.request.user
        challenge = serializer.save(created_by=user)
