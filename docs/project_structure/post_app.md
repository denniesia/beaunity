**🚀 Additional Features**

🔧 Role Management: 

Regular authenticated users have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) permissions for the Post model.
After a post is created, it must be approved by a member of the Superuser group or the Moderator group before it becomes publicly visible. 
Unauthenticated user can see a full list of the posted post, but cannot comment until logged in. 



🌷 Admin Panel

The **PostAdmin** class customizes how **posts** are managed in the Django admin panel:
- List Display: Shows title, created_at, category and created_by fields for quick overview.
- Ordering: **Post** are ordered by created_at in descending order (newest first). 
- Search: Allows searching by title or created_by__username for easier navigation.

## 🌿RestFull Api Contents

**🌻 Serializers:**
ensure the API receives the expected data and responds consistently.

The Model has only one serializer:
- PostSerializer - the **PostSerializer** is used to serialize and deserialize Post objects for the API.

```python
class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    category = serializers.SlugRelatedField(
        queryset=Category.objects.all(),
        slug_field='title'
    )
    created_by = UserSerializer(read_only=True)
    last_updated = serializers.DateTimeField(read_only=True)
    created_at = serializers.DateTimeField(read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = [
            "banner", "title",
            "content", "category",
            "last_updated", "created_by",
            "created_at"
        ]
```


🌻 **API Views** 

- api/#/post/ - This ModelViewSet provides full CRUD operations for the **Post** model. The logged-in user is 
automatically set as the created_by field when creating a post. The category field accepts the title of an existing 
category (slug-based lookup). If the user has the permission to post without approval - belongs to the Moderator's or the 
Superuser's group - the post is automatically approved and posted.
````python

class PostViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]
    serializer_class = PostSerializer

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action in ['update', 'partial_update', 'destroy']:
            return [IsCreatorOrSuperuser()]
        elif self.action == 'create':
            return [IsAuthenticated()]
        return [AllowAny()]

    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        user = self.request.user
        post = serializer.save(created_by=user)

        if user.has_perm('post.can_post_without_approval'):
            post.is_approved = True
            post.save()
