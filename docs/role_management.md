### ðŸ”’ Rolle Management

Beaunity is designed with public and private areas to balance community engagement with controlled interactions.

#### Public Area (Accessible to Everyone)

They cannot interact, comment, or manage any content.

#### Private Area (Requires Account & Roles)

ðŸ”§ Organizer â€“ Focused on event creation, able to add, edit, and delete their own events.

ðŸ”§ Moderator â€“ Handles content moderation in the private space, approving posts/challenges and managing categories.

ðŸ”§ Superuser â€“ Full administrative rights, including changing user group memberships and accessing all areas.

This separation ensures that public visitors can explore safely, while registered users and staff interact and manage 
content in a controlled, community-driven environment.

#### ðŸ”« Key Components

- If anonymous users attempt to access restricted content, they will be redirected to the login page.
- If authenticated users attempt to access content they do not have permission to view, they will be denied access and 
a custom *403 Forbidded* template will appear.
- If users attempt to access content that does not exist, a custom *404 Page not Found* template will appear.
- Staff members see an extra "Administration" option in the navigation.
